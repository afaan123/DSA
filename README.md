pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

## üìñ Learning Path

### 1. Python Fundamentals (Recommended First)
Start with the `python-fundamentals/` directory:
1. **03 - Python Basics** - Core concepts
2. **04 - Conditional Execution** - Control flow
3. **05 - Sequence Types** - Lists, tuples, strings
4. **13 - Functions** - Function fundamentals
5. **08 - Dictionaries** - Key-value data structures
6. **09 - Sets** - Unique element collections

### 2. Advanced Python Concepts
Continue with:
- **10 - Comprehensions** - List, dict, and set comprehensions
- **16 - Higher Order Functions** - Functions as first-class citizens
- **18 - Decorators** - Function decorators and patterns
- **26 - Custom Classes** - Object-oriented programming

### 3. Data Science Libraries
Explore data manipulation and visualization:
- **29 - NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **30 - Pandas** - Data analysis and manipulation
- **31 - Matplotlib** - Data visualization

### 4. DSA Problems
Practice with the `Array_&_Hashing/` problems:
1. Start with **Contains Duplicates** - Basic array manipulation
2. Move to **Two Sums** - Hash map applications
3. Practice **Valid Anagrams** - String manipulation

### 5. Practice and Reinforcement
Use the `practice/` directory for:
- Pattern recognition exercises
- Blind coding practice
- Function implementation drills

## üí° Problem-Solving Approach

For each DSA problem, try to implement multiple solutions:

1. **Brute Force** - Start with the simplest approach
2. **Optimization** - Identify bottlenecks and improve
3. **Alternative Methods** - Explore different algorithms
4. **Time/Space Analysis** - Understand complexity trade-offs

## Testing Your Solutions

Each problem directory contains multiple solution files. Compare their performance:

```python
import time

# Test different approaches
start_time = time.time()
result = solution1(nums)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Solution 1: {end_time - start_time:.6f} seconds")
```
